# Visual Dictionary : Implementation of Tensorflow Object Detection API
Tensorflow object detection API was used to create this application.

<h3>What it does?</h3>
It provides a web page and users can upload images using this web page. After clicking on search button, it will return translation of the object in the picture for different languages. (English, Spanish, German, French and Turkish)

<h3>Which model was used?</h3>
It uses pre-trained SSD model by Google and this model was trained using coco dataset which includes only 91 different object classes. However, you may train your own model with a dataset which includes support of more classes.

<h3>Can another neural network model be used?</h3>
Yes, you can train your own model. So, software will be able to detect much more different object class. This is for referencing and standard SSD model of Google was used.
